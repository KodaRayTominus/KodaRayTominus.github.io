          With over 19 years of experience in IT, I have evolved from hands-on hardware diagnostics to high-level Software Engineering and Cybersecurity. 
          My journey began in 2004 fixing desktops, but my passion for complex systems drove me to pursue higher education. 
          I now hold a <strong>Master of Science in Engineering (Software Engineering)</strong> from Arizona State University and a B.S. in Software Development. 
          Currently, I am further specializing my skillset by pursuing a <strong>Master of Science in Cybersecurity</strong> at Western Governors University.

          I believe technology requires a "lifelong learner" mindset. I don't just maintain systems; I build and secure them. 
          Whether I am running my own MSP-style consultancy, <strong>Tominus Tech Labs</strong>, or acting as the Lead Software Engineer for an indie game studio, 
          I approach every challenge with an engineer's precision and a hacker's curiosity. 
          I am driven to create software that is not only functional but robust, secure, and user-centric.
