            After 13 years as an IT and 2 years working for Geek Squad, I decided to take my experience to the next level. In 2017 I started my
        AAT 2 year degree in Computer Programming and Web Development. I am on track to graduate in 6 quarters, 2 quarters early. I have also 
	been learning Unity on my own as a hobby. I absolutely love technology, which drives me to partake in projects that some consider 
	cutting edge, like machine learning and self-driving cars.

           I love to learn
           While some find learning a new task or concept a chore, I see it as a personal challenge that I truly enjoy. I have been learning 
           about computers and technology since I was 13, where I worked for a computer repair shop fixing desktops and diagnosing their issues.
           While that was the beginning my love never faded, since then I have run private servers and even modded video games through self-teaching
       	   and trial and error.
