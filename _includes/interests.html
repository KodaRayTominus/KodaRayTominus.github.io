        <p>
          Beyond the terminal, my life is defined by continuous improvement and curiosity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Game Engineering & Simulation</b>. My interest in computers began with gaming, but quickly evolved into a passion for <em>how things work</em>. 
            I have spent years self-teaching Unity and C#, moving from consumer to creator. 
            I enjoy dissecting game logic to understand complex state management and AI behaviors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Martial Arts</b>. Discipline is a core value of mine. At age 13, I secured my first job at a computer repair shop specifically to pay for my own karate lessons. 
            That work ethic has stayed with me. Over the years, I have expanded my training to include Taekwondo, Bushido, Muay Thai, Jiu-Jitsu, and Capoeira.

        <h3 style="margin-top:0">Technical Projects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A* Pathfinding Package</strong> (In Staging) - 
            Designed a modular C# pathfinding library optimized for Unity. Decoupled from game logic to ensure reusability across grid-based projects, focusing on heap optimization and memory efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multi-Option NavMesh System</strong> (In Staging) - 
            Engineered a topology-agnostic mesh generation system supporting both <strong>Hexagonal and Cartesian (Square)</strong> grids. Features include toggleable smooth vs. blocky mesh rendering and active development of fluid dynamics for water flow simulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/DaDevFox/KCMods" target="_blank">Elevation Mod (Kingdoms and Castles)</a> - 
            <strong>Algorithm Implementation:</strong> Developing a Hierarchical Path-Finding A* (HPA*) system to introduce verticality and elevation logic into a traditionally flat-plane grid simulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://age-of-aincrad.com/#/" target="_blank">Age of Aincrad</a> - 
            <strong>Lead Software Engineer:</strong> Previously led the engineering team for two years. Responsibilities included architecting backend systems, managing technical debt, and implementing front-end assets within the Unity engine.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
